# I'm relearning to code

I took 4 months off hardcore programming due to burnout, and I accidentally forgot how to write it. This is my playground for relearning how to write code at the same level I could before.

**Scripts**

`yarn` - installs all packages

`yarn run scss` - auto-compiles scss inside the styles folder when changes are made.

## To-Do

`The Deck of Cards`: Create a deck of cards, ignoring jokers, and randomize them, and then place them into a stack that can be drawn from.

`Basic Website`: Create a generic website, simple CSS and HTML without JavaScript.

`Complex Website`: Create a more complex website, SCSS and HTML with JavaScript to handle all events.

`Deck of Cards + Website`: Introduce the Deck of Cards project into a simple webpage that allows the user to draw cards from the pile.
