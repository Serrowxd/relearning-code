# I'm relearning to code

I took 4 months off hardcore programming due to burnout, and I accidentally forgot how to write it. This is my playground for relearning how to write code at the same level I could before.

**Scripts**
`yarn` - installs all packages
`yarn run scss` - auto-compiles scss inside the styles folder when changes are made.
